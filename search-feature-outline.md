# Search Functionality Outline

## Overview
Implement a search bar to allow users to find blog posts by title, tag, or content.

## Goals
- Fast, client-side search for blog posts.
- Search by title, tags, and post content.
- Display results dynamically as the user types.

## Steps
1. Create a `SearchBar.astro` component.
2. Index blog post metadata (title, tags, excerpt) in a JSON or JS object.
3. Implement filtering logic in the component.
4. Display matching results below the search bar.
5. Style the search bar and results for accessibility and responsiveness.
6. Optionally, add keyboard navigation for results.

## Considerations
- Debounce input for performance.
- Highlight matching terms in results.
- Mobile-friendly design.
