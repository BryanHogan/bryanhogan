Add contact information & socials.

To Do's For Me
- Header
    - Later ----
    - make sure a's use :hover & :focus (currently none use focus!)
    - Change icons/links displayed based on props -> Allow different views for blog & portfolio
    - Color - Change base color & different color on hover?
    - Smooth fade out not working for Firefox (How's Safari looking?)
