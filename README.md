To Do's For Me

- General
    -  Images    
      - Sub-folder for images: images/...
      - Large image previews? AMP?
      - Add licensing informtion
    - Structured Data
    - Logo Icon: Cut empty space

    
- Hero
    - Make white text #fff for better readability
    - Make image of me turn to show a different picture after delay
    - Background animation element as an outer edge which could be prettier (make it not go that far right?) | try out different svgs + filter options (maybe use shadow instead?)

- Header
    - Later ----
    - make sure a's use :hover & :focus (currently none use focus!)
    - Change icons/links displayed based on props -> Allow different views for blog & portfolio
    - Color - Change base color & different color on hover?
    - Smooth fade out not working for Firefox (How's Safari looking?)

- Will have to fix
    - Skills link to page with id: Explanation of tool, explanation of hwo I use it
    - Remove component heroLayout
    - Projects headers overlap with header
    - Give skills section max with so & put valuable skills at end and front incae of weird line breaks -> put valuable infront and reverse order for mobile
    - Change up color scheme, more grey for less relevant text & Purple as accent
