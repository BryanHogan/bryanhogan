To Do's For Me

- General
    -  Images    
      - Large image previews? AMP?
      - Add licensing informtion
    - Structured Data
    - Logo Icon: Cut empty space
    - Layout layout have to seperate area: 1. header 2. body

    
- Hero
    - Make white text #fff for better readability
    - Make image of me turn to show a different picture after delay
    - Background animation element as an outer edge which could be prettier (make it not go that far right?) | try out different svgs + filter options (maybe use shadow instead?)

- Header
    - Smooth fade out not working for Firefox (How's Safari looking?)

- Will have to fix
    - Skills link to page with id: Explanation of tool, explanation of how I use it
    - Give skills section max with so & put valuable skills at end and front incae of weird line breaks -> put valuable infront and reverse order for mobile
