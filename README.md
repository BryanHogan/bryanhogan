To Do's For Me

- Fonts
    - 
- Hero
    - Make white text #fff for better readability
    - Make image of me turn to show a different picture after delay
    - Background animation element as an outer edge which could be prettier (make it not go that far right?) | try out different svgs + filter options (maybe use shadow instead?)

- Header
    - Later ----
    - make sure a's use :hover & :focus (currently none use focus!)
    - Change icons/links displayed based on props -> Allow different views for blog & portfolio
    - Color - Change base color & different color on hover?
    - Smooth fade out not working for Firefox (How's Safari looking?)
