<h2 class="text-align-center">Ideas of mine</h2>

- Make a game out of Anki flashcards. Make learning with flashcards more fun. Give option to import cards into it, then ease in the learning process and make the it fun and more efficient, gamify the act of learning with flashcards.
- Build app helper to keep track of things. Make personal overview of health or learning goals. Now working on building this for my [bachelor's final project](/blog/coco-final-dev-diary).
- Make a tool that displays the videos from your "Watch Later" playlist on Youtube in a nice and visually pleasing way.
