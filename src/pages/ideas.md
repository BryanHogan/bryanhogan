<h2 class="text-align-center">Ideas of mine</h2>

- Journaling tool with good science based journaling practices / prompts and AI assistance. Using AI for better prompts, weekly planning and feedback on things, e.g. solutions to problems or evaluations if workload is too much. Use local markdown files, make it interoperable with Obsidian.
- Game that is combination of roguelike, deck- / dice builder, creature-collector and autocombat. Taking inspirations from SpellRogue, DOS2, Pokemon, TFT, The Bazaar, Cobalt Core, Monster Train and Darkest Dungeon.
- X day long Korean learning course, user writes sentences each day, new grammar concept are introduces gradually, receives feedback with AI and content is interwoven with content that has been written by user. Make interface be email or app based. Example: "Yesterday you learnt how to say you like something using the correct markers. You said you like Kimchi. Today we will practice if clauses ..., if you are hungry, what will you eat?" or "This sentence is almost grammatically correct because of ... but a more natural way to say it would be ...".
- Anti social media social media: Open / AT format, focus usage is for interacting with people you know personally, no constant updates, updates only once a day. Move away from dark design patterns.
- SvelteKit-Capacitor-Starter template. Open-source. Make it part of a broader community concept?
- Make a tool that displays the videos from your "Watch Later" playlist on Youtube in a nice and visually pleasing way.
- Travel blog that is interconnected with a map, focussed on locations that I have visited and that are interesting in cities such as Seoul.

If you think anything on this list sounds cool, or anything on my [projects page](/projects) sounds cool as well and you'd like to work together, and/or support me, contact me at one of [my socials](/socials).

### Ideas I actually started working on

Some ideas I wrote above I started to work on so I moved them down into a separate list:

- Make a game out of Anki flashcards. Make learning with flashcards more fun. Give option to import cards into it, then ease in the learning process and make the it fun and more efficient, gamify the act of learning with flashcards.
  - Working on it now! Building [GameToLearnKorean](https://game.tolearnkorean.com/) and also made a [AppToLearnJapanese](https://app.tolearnjapanese.com/) version.
- Build app helper to keep track of things. Make personal overview of health or learning goals.
  - Wrote my thesis about it: [bachelor's final project](/blog/coco-final-dev-diary).
  - Working on it: [DailySelfTrack App landing page](https://dailyselftrack.com/).
