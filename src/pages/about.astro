            Soon to be graduate in <a href="/blog/what-is-coco"

            I have recently spent a year abroad in South Korea, studying at
            different universities. At the beginning of my stay abroad I also
            started with <a href="/blog">BryanHogan.com/blog</a>, a place for me
            to share all the things I would have loved to know about before I
            knew about them.<br />Check out my latest post titled: "<a
                href={`/blog/${allPosts[0].slug}/`}>{allPosts[0].data.title}</a
            >". More on my blog down below.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also run a <a href="/follow">monthly newsletter</a> called "Bryan's
            Briefing" since the beginning of 2024 in which I share what I'm up to,
            cool insights I've recently had and other amazing content I came across.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like described on my <a href="/now">Now page</a>, I'm currently
            working on <a href="https://tolearnkorean.com/" target="_blank"
                >ToLearnKorean.com</a
            > and <a href="https://webdev.bryanhogan.com/" target="_blank"

            in Germany) and <a href="/blog/coco-final-dev-diary"
                >writing my bachelor thesis</a

            your health and wellbeing.

            understanding sleep, to sharing cultural insights and achieving
            personal goals. I want to share my journey and learn alongside
            others.
