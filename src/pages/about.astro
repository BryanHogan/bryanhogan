            About My Blog
        </h2>
        <p>
            In my blog "Bryan's Blog" I delve into topics that captivate my
            heart, all with the aim to also help you. From health-related
            insight such as understanding sleep, to boosting productivity and
            acquiring valuable skills. I want to share my journey and learn
            alongside others.
        </p>
        <p><strong>What I Value & How I Think:</strong></p>

            <li>‚ù§Ô∏è - To life happily in the future you need to be healthy.</li>
            <li>
                ‚è≥ - To achieve ambitious goals some things need to be improved,
                productivity can sometimes help with that.

                üì£ - There's already amazing content out there, and that I want

            <li>
                ‚öôÔ∏è - Modern thinking and building requires some technology. I
