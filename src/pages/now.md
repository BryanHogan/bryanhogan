## My recent story so far

Beginning of 2025 I finished my B.Sc. in [Code & Context](https://bryanhogan.com/blog/what-is-coco) and decided to go abroad. I returned to Korea where I have been for a whole year before, and then went to Macau, a place I have never been to before for an internship.

Now I recently finished [my internship in Macau](https://bryanhogan.com/blog/living-in-macau) but my time abroad continues.

After a month in Korea I came to Japan, by train & ferry! Now in Japan with a working holiday visa.
