- Working on [DailySelfTrack](https://dailyselftrack.com/).
- Looking for people who want to make an app and need someone to develop and design it for them! Doing this as a freelancer.
- Looking for further ways to finance myself, to first survive, and then be able to do my masters in Korea.
- Improving my Korean.

Beginning of this year I finished my B.Sc. in [Code & Context](https://bryanhogan.com/blog/what-is-coco) and decided to go abroad. I returned to Korea where I have been for a whole year before, and then went to Macau, a place I have never been to before for an internship. 

Now I recently finished [my internship in Macau](https://bryanhogan.com/blog/living-in-macau) but my time abroad continues.
