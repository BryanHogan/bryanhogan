<h2 class="text-align-center">About Bryan Hogan</h2>

I'm Bryan Hogan, a (Web) Developer, Digital Creator and Blogger.  
Soon to be graduate in Code & Context, a modern interdisciplinary B.Sc. study in Cologne that combines the fields of computer science, design and entrepreneurship.

I have recently spent a year abroad in South Korea, studying at different universities. At the beginning of my stay abroad I also started with [BryanHogan.com/blog](/blog), a place for me to share all the things I would have loved to know about before I knew about them.

I also run a [monthly newsletter](/follow) called "Bryan's Briefing" since the beginning of 2024 in which I share what I'm up to, cool insights I've recently had and other amazing content I came across.

Take a look at my [Now page](/now) to see what I'm currently doing.
