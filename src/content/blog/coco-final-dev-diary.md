For my last semester at Code & Context I am creating an app to help you keep track of what matters to you. 

## Week 0
After collecting and refining many ideas throughout the past months I've decided on what to write my proposal on. The proposal is short document needed for me to start into my final project and then the bachelor thesis. After working 8-10 weeks on this final project I can start on my thesis.  
Next up was finding a professor willing to be my supervisor and completing the short proposal.

Having overcome both challenges it was my first time back at university for my personal study after my year [abroad in South Korea](/blog/hanyang-erica-exchange). I had a meeting with my supervisor, got feedback on my proposal and now knew in which direction to go into and how to approach my project.

My idea is to build an app which works as a tool for effective journaling, habit building and keeping track of information for self-reflection, achieving goals and improving personal health. One of the first impressions I heard was that it sounds like a "Eierlegende Wollmilchsau", a egg-laying, milk-bearing woolly sow. A German phrase used for something that only has benefits, meets all requirements and is useable for every purpose always, thus it is impossible to create since it's requirements are not feasible for reality.

But the actual idea of the app is not that complex, once per day the user should be prompted to enter information into the app. What information is up to the user. This way the user can choose what they want to keep track of, like how many minutes they have studied, what they did that day, whether they did sports or not, whether they have smoked a cigarette or not, how bad their headache is on a scale from 1 to 5, how well the condition of their stomach is on a scale from 1 to 10 or the status of their mood.  
It only matters that the field can be represented by a simple type of data such as a text field, single word, number, unit, number on a scale or true or false statement.

The user should then be able to view this tracked data in a way that allows them to analyse it, such as a graph or calender view.

What can this be used for?

- 


- one of the greater challenges will be building a suitable and easy to understand interface while still allowing for high customizability and quick ways to enter information.
- quick ways to enter relevant texts and numbers  and displaying them in a way that is useful to the user. being highly customizeable, 

- realizing that it's very hard for me to pitch the idea in just a few words, have a clear idea
Idea is now to build an assistant for effective journaling, habit building and information tracking.
